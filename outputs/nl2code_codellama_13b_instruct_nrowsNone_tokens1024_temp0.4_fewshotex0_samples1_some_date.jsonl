The BFS algorithm used to search the graph is also efficient, with a time complexity of $O(n+m)$.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,29876,29892,286,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,4262,353,518,2636,363,903,297,3464,29898,29876,4638,13,13,1454,903,297,3464,29898,29885,1125,13,1678,269,29892,260,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,1678,3983,29961,29879,1822,4397,29898,29873,29897,13,1678,3983,29961,29873,1822,4397,29898,29879,29897,13,13,29939,353,938,29898,2080,3101,13,13,1454,903,297,3464,29898,29939,1125,13,1678,269,29892,260,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,1678,16669,353,518,8824,29962,334,302,13,1678,9521,353,518,29879,29962,13,1678,1550,9521,29901,13,4706,318,353,9521,29889,7323,29898,29900,29897,13,4706,565,318,1275,260,29901,13,9651,1596,703,3582,1159,13,9651,2867,13,4706,363,325,297,3983,29961,29884,5387,13,9651,565,451,16669,29961,29894,5387,13,18884,16669,29961,29894,29962,353,5852,13,18884,9521,29889,4397,29898,29894,29897,13,1678,1683,29901,13,4706,1596,703,1217,1159,13,28956,13,4013,775,3913,263,3983,848,3829,304,2755,278,5264,3564,29892,988,1269,2943,11524,263,1404,322,278,12770,2755,278,21702,1546,963,29889,450,3983,338,9875,408,385,12109,562,3819,1051,29892,988,1269,2943,756,263,1051,310,967,22092,943,29889,13,13,1576,775,937,13623,278,1881,322,3386,29879,278,3983,29889,1987,29892,363,1269,2346,29892,372,23233,263,18423,386,29899,4102,2740,313,29933,9998,29897,6257,515,278,2752,2943,29889,960,278,3646,2943,338,1476,2645,278,2740,29892,278,775,14677,376,3582,613,6467,372,14677,376,1217,1642,13,13,1576,931,13644,310,445,775,338,395,29949,29898,29876,29974,29885,29974,29939,5767,988,395,29876,29938,338,278,1353,310,4160,29892,395,29885,29938,338,278,1353,310,21702,29892,322,395,29939,29938,338,278,1353,310,9365,29889,450,2913,13644,338,395,29949,29898,29876,29974,29885,5767,607,338,278,2159,310,278,3983,29889,13,13,4013,775,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,3913,263,3983,848,3829,304,2755,278,5264,3564,29892,607,6511,363,8543,2740,322,13310,284,310,278,3564,29889,450,350,9998,5687,1304,304,2740,278,3983,338,884,8543,29892,411,263,931,13644,310,395,29949,29898,29876,29974,29885,4935,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

The code also uses a simple algorithm that is easy to understand and implement.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,5685,397,29918,16846,482,29898,19128,29918,2042,1125,13,1678,396,25455,3651,13,1678,4038,353,29871,29900,13,1678,5685,19653,353,5159,13,1678,1857,29918,29888,417,397,353,5159,13,1678,5685,397,29918,2962,353,29871,29900,13,13,1678,396,20504,403,1549,278,4891,29899,2042,13722,13,1678,363,474,29892,1373,297,26985,29898,19128,29918,2042,1125,13,4706,396,960,591,11735,263,24968,29892,788,372,304,278,1857,5685,397,13,4706,565,1373,1275,525,1966,2396,13,9651,1857,29918,29888,417,397,29889,4397,29898,29875,448,5685,397,29918,2962,29897,13,9651,5685,397,29918,2962,353,474,13,4706,396,960,591,11735,263,12151,1049,29892,788,372,304,278,1857,5685,397,13,4706,25342,1373,1275,8207,2396,13,9651,1857,29918,29888,417,397,29889,4397,29898,29875,448,5685,397,29918,2962,29897,13,9651,5685,397,29918,2962,353,474,13,4706,396,960,591,11735,263,716,5685,397,29892,788,372,304,278,1051,310,5685,19653,13,4706,25342,1373,1275,22868,2396,13,9651,5685,19653,29889,4397,29898,3784,29918,29888,417,397,29897,13,9651,1857,29918,29888,417,397,353,5159,13,9651,5685,397,29918,2962,353,474,13,13,1678,396,20535,403,278,3001,4038,310,599,5685,19653,13,1678,363,5685,397,297,5685,19653,29901,13,4706,4038,4619,2533,29898,29888,417,397,29897,13,13,1678,396,13905,278,3001,4038,322,278,10161,310,1269,5685,397,13,1678,1596,29898,6203,29897,13,1678,1596,29898,2435,29898,29888,417,19653,511,334,29961,2083,29898,29888,417,397,29897,363,5685,397,297,5685,19653,2314,13,13,29888,417,397,29918,16846,482,703,1966,6658,20122,7998,29914,1966,1966,19891,29914,1966,6658,1649,1966,20122,1966,29914,3187,19891,29914,1159,13,28956,13,4013,775,3913,263,2560,5687,304,29611,278,5685,397,18658,29889,739,4256,1078,1549,278,4891,29899,2042,13722,322,14874,5702,310,278,1857,5685,397,322,278,3001,4038,310,599,5685,19653,29889,450,10161,310,1269,5685,397,526,12833,491,2533,4056,701,278,27497,310,599,269,4757,267,322,12151,5252,297,278,5685,397,29889,450,3001,4038,310,599,5685,19653,338,12833,491,2533,4056,701,278,10161,310,1269,5685,397,29889,450,775,769,14677,278,3001,4038,322,278,10161,310,1269,5685,397,29889,13,13,1576,775,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,871,4256,1078,1549,278,4891,29899,2042,13722,2748,322,947,451,671,738,5684,848,12286,304,3787,278,5685,19653,29889,450,775,884,3913,263,2560,5687,393,338,4780,304,2274,322,2334,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It then recursively calls itself on each half, until the base case is reached.\n\nThe `merge` function is then called to merge the two sorted halves back together. It starts by comparing the first elements of each half, and adding the smaller element to the output array. It then moves on to the next element in each half and repeats the process until one of the halves is empty. The remaining elements in the other half are then added to the output array.\n\nThe resulting sorted array is then printed."],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

The `merge_sort` function takes an array as input and recursively splits it into two halves until the base case of an array with one element is reached. The `merge` function is then called to merge the two sorted halves back together.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n log n), which is the best possible time complexity for a comparison-based sorting algorithm. The space complexity is O(n), which is the size of the input array.\n\nHere's an example of how the code works:\n```\narr = [8, 5, 9, 2, 6, 3, 7, 1, 10, 4]\nmerge_sort(arr)\nprint(arr)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\nThe `merge_sort` function first splits the array into two halves: `[8, 5, 9, 2]` and `[6, 3, 7, 1, 10, 4]`. It then recursively calls itself on each half, until the base case is reached.\n\nThe `merge` function is then called to merge the two sorted halves back together. It starts by comparing the first elements of each half, and adding the smaller element to the output array. It then moves on to the next element in each half and repeats the process until one of the halves is empty. The remaining elements in the other half are then added to the output array.\n\nThe resulting sorted array is then printed.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,10366,29918,6605,29898,2749,1125,13,1678,565,7431,29898,2749,29897,1405,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,7145,353,7431,29898,2749,29897,849,29871,29906,13,4706,365,353,3948,7503,6563,29962,13,4706,390,353,3948,29961,6563,17531,13,4706,10366,29918,6605,29898,29931,29897,13,4706,10366,29918,6605,29898,29934,29897,13,4706,10366,29898,2749,29892,365,29892,390,29897,13,13,1753,10366,29898,2749,29892,365,29892,390,1125,13,1678,474,29892,432,353,29871,29900,29892,29871,29900,13,1678,1550,474,529,7431,29898,29931,29897,322,432,529,7431,29898,29934,1125,13,4706,565,365,29961,29875,29962,5277,390,29961,29926,5387,13,9651,3948,29961,29875,29974,29926,29962,353,365,29961,29875,29962,13,9651,474,4619,29871,29896,13,4706,1683,29901,13,9651,3948,29961,29875,29974,29926,29962,353,390,29961,29926,29962,13,9651,432,4619,29871,29896,13,1678,1550,474,529,7431,29898,29931,1125,13,4706,3948,29961,29875,29974,29926,29962,353,365,29961,29875,29962,13,4706,474,4619,29871,29896,13,1678,1550,432,529,7431,29898,29934,1125,13,4706,3948,29961,29875,29974,29926,29962,353,390,29961,29926,29962,13,4706,432,4619,29871,29896,13,13,2749,353,518,29947,29892,29871,29945,29892,29871,29929,29892,29871,29906,29892,29871,29953,29892,29871,29941,29892,29871,29955,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29896,29900,29892,29871,29946,29962,13,14634,29918,6605,29898,2749,29897,13,2158,29898,2749,29897,13,28956,13,4013,775,3913,278,10366,2656,5687,304,2656,278,1409,29889,450,421,14634,29918,6605,29952,740,4893,385,1409,408,1881,322,8304,3598,8536,1169,372,964,1023,8870,1960,2745,278,2967,1206,310,385,1409,411,697,1543,338,7450,29889,450,421,14634,29952,740,338,769,2000,304,10366,278,1023,12705,8870,1960,1250,4208,29889,13,13,1576,931,13644,310,445,775,338,438,29898,29876,1480,302,511,607,338,278,1900,1950,931,13644,363,263,10230,29899,6707,16548,5687,29889,450,2913,13644,338,438,29898,29876,511,607,338,278,2159,310,278,1881,1409,29889,13,13,10605,29915,29879,385,1342,310,920,278,775,1736,29901,13,28956,13,2749,353,518,29947,29892,29871,29945,29892,29871,29929,29892,29871,29906,29892,29871,29953,29892,29871,29941,29892,29871,29955,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29896,29900,29892,29871,29946,29962,13,14634,29918,6605,29898,2749,29897,13,2158,29898,2749,29897,13,28956,13,6466,29901,13,28956,13,29961,29896,29892,29871,29906,29892,29871,29941,29892,29871,29946,29892,29871,29945,29892,29871,29953,29892,29871,29955,29892,29871,29947,29892,29871,29929,29892,29871,29896,29900,29962,13,28956,13,1576,421,14634,29918,6605,29952,740,937,8536,1169,278,1409,964,1023,8870,1960,29901,10338,29947,29892,29871,29945,29892,29871,29929,29892,29871,29906,7961,322,10338,29953,29892,29871,29941,29892,29871,29955,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29896,29900,29892,29871,29946,27865,739,769,8304,3598,5717,3528,373,1269,4203,29892,2745,278,2967,1206,338,7450,29889,13,13,1576,421,14634,29952,740,338,769,2000,304,10366,278,1023,12705,8870,1960,1250,4208,29889,739,8665,491,17420,278,937,3161,310,1269,4203,29892,322,4417,278,7968,1543,304,278,1962,1409,29889,739,769,16229,373,304,278,2446,1543,297,1269,4203,322,5565,1446,278,1889,2745,697,310,278,8870,1960,338,4069,29889,450,9886,3161,297,278,916,4203,526,769,2715,304,278,1962,1409,29889,13,13,1576,9819,12705,1409,338,769,13350,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It also uses the `map` function to convert the input strings to integers, which is more efficient than using a loop to iterate over the input strings and convert them to integers.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,679,29918,8228,29898,29885,29892,285,29892,364,1125,13,1678,565,286,1275,448,29896,470,285,1275,448,29896,29901,13,4706,736,525,29943,29915,13,1678,3001,29918,13628,353,286,718,285,13,1678,565,3001,29918,13628,6736,29871,29947,29900,29901,13,4706,736,525,29909,29915,13,1678,25342,3001,29918,13628,6736,29871,29953,29945,322,3001,29918,13628,529,29871,29947,29900,29901,13,4706,736,525,29933,29915,13,1678,25342,3001,29918,13628,6736,29871,29945,29900,322,3001,29918,13628,529,29871,29953,29945,29901,13,4706,736,525,29907,29915,13,1678,25342,3001,29918,13628,6736,29871,29941,29900,322,3001,29918,13628,529,29871,29945,29900,29901,13,4706,736,525,29928,29915,13,1678,1683,29901,13,4706,736,525,29943,29915,13,13,1753,1667,7295,13,1678,1550,5852,29901,13,4706,286,29892,285,29892,364,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,4706,565,286,1275,448,29896,322,285,1275,448,29896,322,364,1275,448,29896,29901,13,9651,2867,13,4706,1596,29898,657,29918,8228,29898,29885,29892,285,29892,364,876,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,525,1649,3396,1649,2396,13,1678,1667,580,13,28956,13,13,4013,775,3913,263,740,421,657,29918,8228,29952,304,8147,278,19468,2729,373,278,1881,19435,29889,450,740,4893,278,7145,8489,8158,421,29885,1673,2186,8158,421,29888,1673,322,1207,786,8158,421,29878,29952,408,1881,29892,322,3639,278,6590,19468,29889,13,13,1576,740,937,12747,565,278,8368,1258,451,2125,278,7145,8489,470,2186,4392,3381,29892,322,565,577,29892,3639,525,29943,29915,408,278,19468,29889,13466,29892,372,3408,1078,278,3001,8158,491,4417,278,7145,8489,322,2186,19435,29889,13,13,3644,278,3001,8158,338,7621,1135,470,5186,304,29871,29947,29900,29892,278,8368,29915,29879,19468,338,525,29909,4286,960,278,3001,8158,338,7621,1135,470,5186,304,29871,29953,29945,541,3109,1135,29871,29947,29900,29892,278,8368,29915,29879,19468,338,525,29933,4286,960,278,3001,8158,338,7621,1135,470,5186,304,29871,29945,29900,541,3109,1135,29871,29953,29945,29892,278,8368,29915,29879,19468,338,525,29907,4286,960,278,3001,8158,338,7621,1135,470,5186,304,29871,29941,29900,541,3109,1135,29871,29945,29900,29892,278,8368,29915,29879,19468,338,525,29928,4286,13,13,3644,278,3001,8158,338,3109,1135,29871,29941,29900,29892,278,8368,29915,29879,19468,338,525,29943,4286,13,13,1576,421,3396,29952,740,28424,9508,29879,278,1404,363,1881,2745,278,1404,24395,2211,448,29896,1819,363,278,7145,8489,29892,2186,29892,322,1207,786,19435,29892,8307,29889,739,769,5717,278,421,657,29918,8228,29952,740,304,8147,278,19468,363,1269,8783,322,14677,278,1121,29889,13,13,4013,775,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,3913,263,2323,740,304,8147,278,19468,363,1269,8783,29892,607,4772,29879,278,817,304,12312,278,1021,775,2999,3064,29889,739,884,3913,278,421,1958,29952,740,304,3588,278,1881,6031,304,11920,29892,607,338,901,8543,1135,773,263,2425,304,13649,975,278,1881,6031,322,3588,963,304,11920,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It uses a more efficient data structure for the edges, and it uses a more efficient algorithm for finding the groups of friends.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,1753,679,29918,13155,29898,29876,29892,286,29892,12770,1125,13,1678,6471,353,5159,13,1678,16669,353,518,8824,29962,334,313,29876,718,29871,29896,29897,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29896,29892,302,718,29871,29896,1125,13,4706,565,451,16669,29961,29875,5387,13,9651,2318,353,5159,13,9651,4489,29879,29898,29875,29892,16669,29892,2318,29892,12770,29897,13,9651,6471,29889,4397,29898,2972,29897,13,1678,736,6471,13,13,1753,4489,29879,29898,3177,29892,16669,29892,2318,29892,12770,1125,13,1678,16669,29961,3177,29962,353,5852,13,1678,2318,29889,4397,29898,3177,29897,13,1678,363,12307,297,12770,29961,3177,5387,13,4706,565,451,16669,29961,484,1141,4089,5387,13,9651,4489,29879,29898,484,1141,4089,29892,16669,29892,2318,29892,12770,29897,13,13,29876,29892,286,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,287,2710,353,518,2636,363,903,297,3464,29898,29876,718,29871,29896,4638,13,1454,903,297,3464,29898,29885,1125,13,1678,263,29892,289,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,1678,12770,29961,29874,1822,4397,29898,29890,29897,13,1678,12770,29961,29890,1822,4397,29898,29874,29897,13,13155,353,679,29918,13155,29898,29876,29892,286,29892,12770,29897,13,2158,29898,2435,29898,13155,876,13,28956,13,13,4013,775,3913,263,10809,29899,4102,2740,313,4037,29903,29897,5687,304,1284,278,6471,310,7875,29889,739,8665,491,4969,263,1051,310,12770,29892,988,1269,7636,338,9875,491,263,18761,310,1023,7573,29889,739,769,4256,1078,975,278,12770,322,3913,278,360,9998,5687,304,1284,278,6471,310,7875,29889,13,13,1576,360,9998,5687,1736,491,8304,3598,6493,292,1269,2943,297,278,3983,29892,2791,292,1269,2943,408,16669,408,372,5771,29889,1932,263,2943,338,16669,363,278,937,931,29892,372,338,2715,304,278,1857,2318,29889,960,263,2943,756,2307,1063,16669,29892,372,338,451,2715,304,278,1857,2318,29889,13,13,1576,775,3913,263,16669,1409,304,3013,5702,310,607,7573,505,2307,1063,16669,29889,910,1409,338,16601,304,599,2089,1819,29892,322,338,4784,408,278,360,9998,5687,1998,1169,1269,2943,29889,13,13,1576,775,884,3913,263,2318,1409,304,3013,5702,310,278,6471,310,7875,29889,7806,2318,338,9875,491,263,1051,310,7573,29889,13,13,1576,2186,4331,338,304,1596,278,1353,310,6471,1476,29889,13,13,4013,775,756,263,931,13644,310,438,29898,29876,718,286,511,988,302,338,278,1353,310,7573,322,286,338,278,1353,310,12770,29889,450,2913,13644,338,438,29898,29876,511,1951,278,16669,322,2318,7049,526,310,2159,302,29889,13,13,4013,775,338,901,8543,1135,278,3517,697,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,29889,739,3913,263,901,8543,848,3829,363,278,12770,29892,322,372,3913,263,901,8543,5687,363,9138,278,6471,310,7875,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

This approach also avoids the need to store all possible combinations of indices in a data structure, which would require a significant amount of memory.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,2302,29918,9910,2701,29898,29903,1125,13,1678,302,353,7431,29898,29903,29897,13,1678,2302,353,29871,29900,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29876,1125,13,4706,363,432,297,3464,29898,29875,29974,29896,29892,302,29974,29896,1125,13,9651,954,353,938,29898,29903,29961,29875,29901,29926,2314,13,9651,565,954,1273,29871,29906,29900,29896,29929,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,18884,2302,4619,29871,29896,13,1678,736,2302,13,28956,13,13,4013,1650,3913,263,1023,29899,7888,2948,304,13649,975,599,1950,11000,310,16285,297,278,1347,29889,1152,1269,5101,310,16285,29892,372,6597,29879,278,28228,1546,963,322,12747,565,372,338,263,2999,310,29871,29906,29900,29896,29929,29889,960,372,338,29892,372,3079,1860,263,6795,29889,450,931,13644,310,445,1650,338,438,29898,29876,29985,29906,511,988,302,338,278,3309,310,278,1881,1347,29889,450,2913,13644,338,438,29898,29896,511,1951,591,871,817,304,3787,278,6795,2286,29889,13,13,4013,1650,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,4772,29879,278,817,304,3588,278,4152,1347,304,385,6043,322,769,1423,565,372,338,263,2999,310,29871,29906,29900,29896,29929,29889,8669,29892,372,871,12747,278,28228,1546,278,1023,16285,29892,607,338,263,7968,322,901,10933,519,11910,310,278,1347,29889,910,2948,884,4772,29879,278,817,304,3787,599,1950,18240,310,16285,297,263,848,3829,29892,607,723,1996,263,7282,5253,310,3370,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

The `get_paths` and `get_simple_paths` functions are also efficient because they use a single pass through the graph to find the paths and simple paths that visit a certain color, which reduces the time complexity to O(N^2) and O(N) respectively.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,1753,679,29918,24772,29898,4262,29892,2927,1125,13,1678,10898,353,5159,13,1678,363,2943,297,3983,29901,13,4706,565,2943,29961,29896,29962,1275,2927,29901,13,9651,10898,29889,4397,29898,3177,29961,29900,2314,13,1678,736,10898,13,13,1753,679,29918,12857,29918,24772,29898,4262,29892,2927,1125,13,1678,10898,353,679,29918,24772,29898,4262,29892,2927,29897,13,1678,2560,29918,24772,353,5159,13,1678,363,2224,297,10898,29901,13,4706,565,7431,29898,2084,29897,1275,29871,29906,29901,13,9651,2560,29918,24772,29889,4397,29898,2084,29897,13,4706,1683,29901,13,9651,363,474,297,3464,29898,29896,29892,7431,29898,2084,29897,448,29871,29896,1125,13,18884,565,2224,29961,29875,29962,2804,2224,29961,29875,448,29871,29896,29962,322,2224,29961,29875,29962,2804,2224,29961,29875,718,29871,29896,5387,13,462,1678,2560,29918,24772,29889,4397,29898,2084,29961,29875,29901,29875,718,29871,29906,2314,13,1678,736,2560,29918,24772,13,13,1753,1667,7295,13,1678,405,353,938,29898,2080,3101,13,1678,11955,353,1051,29898,1958,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,22130,13,1678,3983,353,5159,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29940,448,29871,29896,1125,13,4706,263,29892,289,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,4706,3983,29889,4397,3552,29874,29892,11955,29961,29874,448,29871,29896,12622,13,4706,3983,29889,4397,3552,29890,29892,11955,29961,29890,448,29871,29896,12622,13,1678,363,2927,297,3464,29898,29896,29892,405,718,29871,29896,1125,13,4706,1596,29898,2435,29898,657,29918,12857,29918,24772,29898,4262,29892,2927,4961,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,376,1649,3396,1649,1115,13,1678,1667,580,13,28956,13,4013,775,3913,263,3983,848,3829,304,2755,278,5447,29892,988,1269,2943,338,263,12688,322,1269,7636,338,263,2560,2224,16791,1023,13791,29889,450,421,657,29918,24772,29952,740,3639,263,1051,310,599,278,10898,393,6493,263,12688,23139,297,263,3058,2927,29892,322,278,421,657,29918,12857,29918,24772,29952,740,3639,263,1051,310,599,278,2560,10898,393,6493,263,12688,23139,297,263,3058,2927,29889,450,421,3396,29952,740,4893,278,1881,29892,10017,278,3983,29892,322,769,3913,278,421,657,29918,12857,29918,24772,29952,740,304,1284,278,1353,310,2560,10898,393,6493,263,12688,23139,297,1269,2927,29889,9788,29892,372,14677,278,1353,310,2560,10898,363,1269,2927,29889,13,13,1576,931,13644,310,445,775,338,438,29898,29940,29985,29906,511,988,405,338,278,1353,310,13791,297,278,5447,29889,910,338,1363,278,421,657,29918,24772,29952,740,756,304,13649,975,599,278,13791,297,278,3983,304,1284,278,10898,393,6493,263,3058,2927,29892,322,278,421,657,29918,12857,29918,24772,29952,740,756,304,13649,975,599,278,10898,304,1284,278,2560,10898,393,6493,263,3058,2927,29889,450,2913,13644,338,438,29898,29940,511,988,405,338,278,1353,310,13791,297,278,5447,29892,1363,278,3983,848,3829,6858,438,29898,29940,29897,2913,304,3787,599,278,13791,322,12770,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,445,775,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,3913,263,3983,848,3829,304,2755,278,5447,29892,607,6511,363,8543,11975,322,11525,2785,310,278,848,29889,450,421,657,29918,24772,29952,322,421,657,29918,12857,29918,24772,29952,3168,526,884,8543,1363,896,671,263,2323,1209,1549,278,3983,304,1284,278,10898,322,2560,10898,393,6493,263,3058,2927,29892,607,26830,278,931,13644,304,438,29898,29940,29985,29906,29897,322,438,29898,29940,29897,8307,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

(See Notes for the description of Rock Paper Scissors. A draw also counts as a round.)\nEach time the player wins a round, depending on which hand he\/she uses, he\/she earns the following score (no points for a draw or a loss):\nR\npoints for winning with Rock;\nS\npoints for winning with Scissors;\nP\npoints for winning with Paper.\nHowever, in the\ni\n-th round, the player cannot use the hand he\/she used in the\n(i-K)\n-th round. (In the first\nK\nrounds, the player can use any hand.)\nBefore the start of the game, the machine decides the hand it will play in each round.

The space complexity is `O(N)`, since we need to store the input sequences in memory.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input sequences are given in the standard input format, i.e., the first line contains the length of the sequences, and the following lines contain the elements of the sequences.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,1753,338,29918,496,10384,519,29898,29909,29892,350,1125,13,1678,405,353,7431,29898,29909,29897,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29940,1125,13,4706,565,319,29961,29875,29962,1405,350,29961,29875,5387,13,9651,736,7700,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29940,29899,29906,1125,13,4706,363,432,297,3464,29898,29875,29974,29896,29892,405,29899,29896,1125,13,9651,565,319,29961,29875,29962,1405,350,29961,29926,29962,470,319,29961,29926,29962,1405,350,29961,29875,5387,13,18884,736,7700,13,1678,736,5852,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,376,1649,3396,1649,1115,13,1678,405,353,938,29898,2080,3101,13,1678,319,353,1051,29898,1958,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,22130,13,1678,350,353,1051,29898,1958,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,22130,13,1678,1596,703,8241,29908,565,338,29918,496,10384,519,29898,29909,29892,350,29897,1683,376,3782,1159,13,28956,13,13,4013,775,3913,278,1494,2948,29901,13,13,29896,29889,3824,29892,372,12747,565,278,12091,338,27012,519,491,8454,565,421,29909,29961,29875,29962,5277,350,29961,29875,7961,363,599,421,29875,29952,515,421,29896,29952,304,421,29940,29899,29896,1412,960,738,310,1438,5855,338,451,1539,29892,372,3639,421,8824,1412,13,29906,29889,8084,29892,372,12747,565,372,338,1950,304,6176,278,12091,491,2381,20304,1023,3161,472,1556,421,29940,29899,29906,29952,3064,29889,739,947,445,491,4256,1218,975,599,1950,11000,310,3161,12270,29875,29892,432,3569,1316,393,421,29875,529,432,29952,322,421,29875,29892,432,29952,526,8359,29889,1152,1269,5101,29892,372,12747,565,421,29909,29961,29875,29962,1405,350,29961,29926,7961,470,421,29909,29961,29926,29962,1405,350,29961,29875,27865,960,738,310,1438,5855,338,1539,29892,372,3639,421,8824,1412,960,599,5855,526,451,1539,29892,372,3639,421,5574,1412,13,29941,29889,9788,29892,372,14677,421,8241,29952,565,278,12091,338,27012,519,29892,322,421,3782,29952,6467,29889,13,13,1576,931,13644,310,445,775,338,421,29949,29898,29940,29985,29906,3569,297,278,17322,1206,29892,988,421,29940,29952,338,278,3309,310,278,1881,15602,29889,450,2913,13644,338,421,29949,29898,29940,20362,1951,591,817,304,3787,278,1881,15602,297,3370,29889,13,13,9842,393,445,775,15894,393,278,1881,15602,526,2183,297,278,3918,1881,3402,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,278,937,1196,3743,278,3309,310,278,15602,29892,322,278,1494,3454,1712,278,3161,310,278,15602,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

If performance is a concern, there are several ways to optimize the solution, such as using a more efficient algorithm or optimizing the implementation of the algorithm.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,1753,4505,29898,29940,1125,13,1678,341,13668,353,29871,29929,29929,29947,29906,29946,29946,29941,29945,29941,13,1678,2302,353,29871,29900,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29896,29892,405,29899,29896,1125,13,4706,363,432,297,3464,29898,29875,29974,29896,29892,405,1125,13,9651,565,269,29961,29875,29962,2804,269,29961,29926,29962,322,269,29961,29875,29962,2804,269,29961,29926,29899,29896,29962,322,269,29961,29875,29899,29896,29962,2804,269,29961,29926,5387,13,18884,2302,4619,29871,29896,13,1678,736,2302,1273,341,13668,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,376,1649,3396,1649,1115,13,1678,405,353,938,29898,9675,29889,4172,262,29889,949,1220,2141,17010,3101,13,1678,1596,29898,2929,345,29898,29940,876,13,28956,13,13,4013,1650,3913,263,1506,1082,4889,2948,29892,4256,1218,975,599,1950,11000,310,18942,4890,297,278,1347,322,21248,278,1353,310,11000,393,15523,278,4195,29889,450,931,13644,310,445,1650,338,438,29898,29940,29985,29906,511,607,338,8543,3307,363,278,2183,11938,29889,450,2913,13644,338,884,438,29898,29896,511,1951,591,871,817,304,3787,278,1347,322,278,2302,310,2854,11000,29889,13,13,9842,393,278,1650,338,27545,363,1303,3097,322,7542,537,29892,3265,1135,4180,29889,960,4180,338,263,5932,29892,727,526,3196,5837,304,24656,278,1650,29892,1316,408,773,263,901,8543,5687,470,5994,5281,278,5314,310,278,5687,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

If they are not, it recursively calls the function with the input values divided by 2, and multiplies the result by 2.\n\nThis approach is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage, as it only requires a constant amount of memory to store the results of each recursive call, and the time complexity is O(log(n)), where n is the maximum value of the input values.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,4505,29898,29874,29892,289,1125,13,1678,565,263,1275,29871,29900,470,289,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,4706,736,29871,29900,13,1678,565,263,1275,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,289,13,1678,565,289,1275,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,263,13,1678,565,263,1275,289,29901,13,4706,736,263,334,289,13,1678,565,263,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29900,322,289,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,4706,736,4505,29898,29874,849,29871,29906,29892,289,849,29871,29906,29897,334,29871,29946,13,1678,565,263,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29900,322,289,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,4505,29898,29874,849,29871,29906,29892,289,849,29871,29906,29897,334,29871,29906,13,1678,565,263,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29896,322,289,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,4706,736,4505,29898,29874,849,29871,29906,29892,289,849,29871,29906,29897,334,29871,29906,13,1678,565,263,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29896,322,289,1273,29871,29906,1275,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,4505,29898,29874,849,29871,29906,29892,289,849,29871,29906,29897,334,29871,29946,13,1678,736,448,29896,13,28956,13,4013,1650,3913,263,16732,2948,304,4505,278,1108,29889,739,937,12747,565,278,1881,1819,526,2854,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,565,896,526,1546,29871,29896,322,29871,29929,20978,573,467,960,896,526,451,29892,372,3639,448,29896,29889,13,13,3644,278,1881,1819,526,2854,29892,372,12747,565,896,526,5186,304,29871,29900,470,29871,29896,29892,297,607,1206,278,1121,338,29871,29900,470,278,1881,995,29892,8307,29889,13,13,3644,278,1881,1819,526,451,5186,304,29871,29900,470,29871,29896,29892,372,12747,565,896,526,1716,1584,470,1716,7736,29889,960,896,526,29892,372,8304,3598,5717,278,740,411,278,1881,1819,13931,491,29871,29906,29892,322,6674,3687,278,1121,491,29871,29946,29889,960,896,526,451,29892,372,8304,3598,5717,278,740,411,278,1881,1819,13931,491,29871,29906,29892,322,6674,3687,278,1121,491,29871,29906,29889,13,13,4013,2948,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,29892,408,372,871,6858,263,4868,5253,310,3370,304,3787,278,2582,310,1269,16732,1246,29892,322,278,931,13644,338,438,29898,1188,29898,29876,8243,988,302,338,278,7472,995,310,278,1881,1819,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(sqrt(min(A, B))) because the list can store at most sqrt(min(A, B)) elements.\n\nOverall, this algorithm is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the problem.","token_ids":[29871,2266,338,263,5132,5314,310,385,8543,5687,363,278,1108,29901,13,28956,13,1753,679,29918,9435,29918,4563,275,943,29898,29909,29892,350,1125,13,1678,8572,943,353,731,580,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29896,29892,1375,29898,29909,29892,350,29897,718,29871,29896,1125,13,4706,565,319,1273,474,1275,29871,29900,322,350,1273,474,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,9651,8572,943,29889,1202,29898,29875,29897,13,1678,736,8572,943,13,13,1753,679,29918,9708,29878,603,29918,4563,275,943,29898,29909,29892,350,29892,8572,943,1125,13,1678,5614,29878,603,29918,4563,275,943,353,5159,13,1678,363,474,297,8572,943,29901,13,4706,565,338,29918,9708,29878,603,29898,29875,29892,319,29897,322,338,29918,9708,29878,603,29898,29875,29892,350,1125,13,9651,5614,29878,603,29918,4563,275,943,29889,4397,29898,29875,29897,13,1678,736,5614,29878,603,29918,4563,275,943,13,13,1753,338,29918,9708,29878,603,29898,29916,29892,343,1125,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29906,29892,921,1125,13,4706,565,921,1273,474,1275,29871,29900,322,343,1273,474,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,9651,736,7700,13,1678,736,5852,13,13,1753,679,29918,3317,29918,4563,275,943,29898,29909,29892,350,1125,13,1678,8572,943,353,679,29918,9435,29918,4563,275,943,29898,29909,29892,350,29897,13,1678,5614,29878,603,29918,4563,275,943,353,679,29918,9708,29878,603,29918,4563,275,943,29898,29909,29892,350,29892,8572,943,29897,13,1678,736,7431,29898,9708,29878,603,29918,4563,275,943,29897,13,13,1753,1667,7295,13,1678,319,29892,350,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,1678,1596,29898,657,29918,3317,29918,4563,275,943,29898,29909,29892,350,876,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,376,1649,3396,1649,1115,13,1678,1667,580,13,28956,13,4013,5687,756,263,931,13644,310,438,29898,3676,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,4961,322,263,2913,13644,310,438,29898,3676,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,876,467,739,937,14061,278,3619,8572,943,310,319,322,350,773,278,382,27511,5687,29892,322,769,372,18094,278,8572,943,304,871,3160,278,6743,393,526,5614,29878,603,304,1716,319,322,350,29889,9788,29892,372,3639,278,3309,310,278,1051,310,5614,29878,603,8572,943,29889,13,13,1576,5687,3913,263,731,304,3787,278,3619,8572,943,29892,607,756,263,931,13644,310,438,29898,29896,29897,363,4635,291,322,16280,29892,577,278,12463,931,13644,310,278,5687,338,438,29898,3676,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,876,467,450,2913,13644,310,278,5687,338,438,29898,3676,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,4961,1363,278,731,508,3787,472,1556,18074,2273,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,876,3161,29889,13,13,1576,5687,884,3913,263,1051,304,3787,278,5614,29878,603,8572,943,29892,607,756,263,931,13644,310,438,29898,29896,29897,363,4635,291,322,16280,29892,577,278,12463,931,13644,310,278,5687,338,438,29898,3676,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,876,467,450,2913,13644,310,278,5687,338,438,29898,3676,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,4961,1363,278,1051,508,3787,472,1556,18074,2273,29898,1195,29898,29909,29892,350,876,3161,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,445,5687,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,363,278,1108,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It first sorts the jobs by their deadlines, and then loops through the jobs in the sorted order. For each job, it checks if it can be completed before the deadline, and if so, it completes the job and updates the current time. If the job cannot be completed before the deadline, it returns \"No\". If all jobs have been completed, it returns \"Yes\".\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N\\*log(N)) and a space complexity of O(N), where N is the number of jobs. The sorting step takes O(N\\*log(N)) time, and the loop takes O(N) time, so the total time complexity is O(N\\*log(N)) + O(N) = O(N\\*log(N)). The space complexity is O(N) for the sorted jobs list."],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It first sorts the jobs by their deadlines, and then loops through the jobs in the sorted order. For each job, it checks if it can be completed before the deadline, and if so, it completes the job and updates the current time. If the job cannot be completed before the deadline, it returns \"No\". If all jobs have been completed, it returns \"Yes\".\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N\\*log(N)) and a space complexity of O(N), where N is the number of jobs. The sorting step takes O(N\\*log(N)) time, and the loop takes O(N) time, so the total time complexity is O(N\\*log(N)) + O(N) = O(N\\*log(N)). The space complexity is O(N) for the sorted jobs list.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,1753,4505,29898,29940,29892,319,29892,350,1125,13,1678,396,20025,278,17643,491,7123,1220,13,1678,12705,29918,9057,29879,353,12705,29898,7554,29898,29909,29892,350,511,1820,29922,2892,921,29901,921,29961,29896,2314,13,13,1678,396,25455,278,1857,931,322,278,1353,310,17643,8676,13,1678,1857,29918,2230,353,29871,29900,13,1678,954,29918,5729,9446,353,29871,29900,13,13,1678,396,21493,1549,278,12705,17643,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29940,1125,13,4706,396,3617,278,2446,4982,322,967,7123,1220,13,4706,4982,29892,7123,1220,353,12705,29918,9057,29879,29961,29875,29962,13,13,4706,396,5399,565,278,4982,508,367,8676,1434,278,7123,1220,13,4706,565,1857,29918,2230,718,4982,5277,7123,1220,29901,13,9651,396,25034,278,4982,322,2767,278,1857,931,13,9651,1857,29918,2230,4619,4982,13,9651,954,29918,5729,9446,4619,29871,29896,13,4706,1683,29901,13,9651,396,450,4982,2609,367,8676,1434,278,7123,1220,13,9651,736,376,3782,29908,13,13,1678,396,5399,565,599,17643,505,1063,8676,13,1678,565,954,29918,5729,9446,1275,405,29901,13,4706,736,376,8241,29908,13,1678,1683,29901,13,4706,736,376,3782,29908,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,376,1649,3396,1649,1115,13,1678,405,353,938,29898,2080,3101,13,1678,319,353,1051,29898,1958,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,22130,13,1678,350,353,1051,29898,1958,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,22130,13,1678,1596,29898,2929,345,29898,29940,29892,319,29892,350,876,13,28956,13,4013,1650,3913,263,1395,7584,2948,304,4505,278,1108,29889,739,937,23551,278,17643,491,1009,7123,9012,29892,322,769,12104,1549,278,17643,297,278,12705,1797,29889,1152,1269,4982,29892,372,12747,565,372,508,367,8676,1434,278,7123,1220,29892,322,565,577,29892,372,1614,2167,278,4982,322,11217,278,1857,931,29889,960,278,4982,2609,367,8676,1434,278,7123,1220,29892,372,3639,376,3782,1642,960,599,17643,505,1063,8676,29892,372,3639,376,8241,1642,13,13,4013,1650,756,263,931,13644,310,438,29898,29940,29905,29930,1188,29898,29940,876,322,263,2913,13644,310,438,29898,29940,511,988,405,338,278,1353,310,17643,29889,450,16548,4331,4893,438,29898,29940,29905,29930,1188,29898,29940,876,931,29892,322,278,2425,4893,438,29898,29940,29897,931,29892,577,278,3001,931,13644,338,438,29898,29940,29905,29930,1188,29898,29940,876,718,438,29898,29940,29897,353,438,29898,29940,29905,29930,1188,29898,29940,8106,450,2913,13644,338,438,29898,29940,29897,363,278,12705,17643,1051,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

Additionally, the solution uses the `all` function to check if all the sub-sequences of a given sequence are divisible, which reduces the number of iterations needed to be made.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,1753,679,29918,915,1300,29891,29898,2749,1125,13,1678,736,3948,29961,29900,29962,6228,3948,14352,29896,29962,13,13,1753,338,29918,4563,275,1821,29898,2749,29892,413,1125,13,1678,15409,353,679,29918,915,1300,29891,29898,2749,29897,13,1678,736,599,29898,657,29918,915,1300,29891,29898,2749,29961,29875,29901,29875,29974,29895,2314,1275,15409,363,474,297,3464,29898,2435,29898,2749,29897,448,413,718,29871,29896,876,13,13,1753,2302,29918,4563,275,1821,29898,2749,1125,13,1678,2302,353,29871,29900,13,1678,363,413,297,3464,29898,29896,29892,7431,29898,2749,22164,13,4706,565,338,29918,4563,275,1821,29898,2749,29892,413,1125,13,9651,2302,4619,29871,29896,13,1678,736,2302,13,13,1753,4505,29898,2749,1125,13,1678,736,2302,29918,4563,275,1821,29898,2749,29897,1273,313,29896,29900,1068,29929,718,29871,29955,29897,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,376,1649,3396,1649,1115,13,1678,3948,353,1051,29898,1958,29898,524,29892,10876,29889,4172,262,29889,949,1220,2141,5451,22130,13,1678,1596,29898,2929,345,29898,2749,876,13,28956,13,13,4013,1650,3913,278,1060,1955,2875,310,278,15409,740,304,8161,565,263,2183,5665,310,3309,413,338,8572,1821,29889,26321,29892,372,12747,565,278,15409,310,278,937,322,1833,3161,310,278,5665,526,5186,29892,322,565,278,15409,310,278,5665,338,5186,304,278,15409,310,1269,310,967,1014,29899,6831,2063,310,3309,413,29889,13,13,1576,421,275,29918,4563,275,1821,29952,740,4893,385,1409,322,263,3309,413,408,1881,29892,322,3639,5852,565,278,5665,338,8572,1821,29892,322,7700,6467,29889,13,13,1576,421,2798,29918,4563,275,1821,29952,740,4893,385,1409,408,1881,322,3639,278,1353,310,8572,1821,15602,310,3309,413,363,1269,413,297,278,3464,29871,29896,304,7431,29898,2749,467,13,13,1576,421,2929,345,29952,740,4893,385,1409,408,1881,322,3639,278,2302,310,8572,1821,15602,878,7207,29871,29896,29900,29985,29929,718,29871,29955,29889,13,13,1576,1650,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,3913,278,1060,1955,2875,310,278,15409,740,304,8161,565,263,2183,5665,338,8572,1821,29892,607,26830,278,1353,310,5734,14125,4312,304,367,1754,29889,19814,29892,278,1650,3913,278,421,497,29952,740,304,1423,565,599,278,1014,29899,6831,2063,310,263,2183,5665,526,8572,1821,29892,607,26830,278,1353,310,24372,4312,304,367,1754,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It first checks if the piece can be moved in the direction of `S[i]` or `T[i]` in the first `N` steps, and if it can, it moves the piece in that direction. If the piece is removed during the first `N` steps, it returns `False`. If the piece is not removed, it checks if the piece can be moved in the direction of `S[i]` or `T[i]` in the next `N` steps, and if it can, it moves the piece in that direction. If the piece is removed during the next `N` steps, it returns `False`. If the piece is not removed, it returns `True`.\n\nThe solution uses the `is_valid_move` function to check if the piece can be moved to a valid square, and the `move_piece` function to move the piece to the new square. The `is_piece_removed` function is used to check if the piece is removed from the grid.\n\nThe solution runs in O(N) time and O(1) space, where N is the number of steps in the game. This is because the algorithm only needs to check each square once, and it does not use any additional data structures."],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

Let\n(i,j)\ndenote the square at the\ni\n-th row from the top and the\nj\n-th column from the left.\nOn this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square\n(s_r,s_c)\n.\nTakahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length\nN\n.\nTakahashi's string is\nS\n, and Aoki's string is\nT\n.\nS\nand\nT\nboth consist of four kinds of letters:\nL\n,\nR\n,\nU\nand\nD\n.\nThe game consists of\nN\nsteps. The\ni\n-th step proceeds as follows:\nFirst, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of\nS_i\n, or does not move the piece.\nSecond, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of\nT_i\n, or does not move the piece.\nHere, to move the piece in the direction of\nL\n,\nR\n,\nU\nand\nD\n, is to move the piece from square\n(r,c)\nto square\n(r,c-1)\n,\n(r,c+1)\n,\n(r-1,c)\nand\n(r+1,c)\n, respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than\nN\nsteps are done.\nTakahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the\nN\nsteps.\nAoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the\nN\nsteps with the piece remaining on the grid.\nDetermine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.\nConstraints\n2 \\leq H,W \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n1 \\leq s_r \\leq H\n1 \\leq s_c \\leq W\n|S|=|T|=N\nS\nand\nT\nconsists of the four kinds of letters\nL\n,\nR\n,\nU\nand\nD\n.\nInput\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH\nW\nN\ns_r\ns_c\nS\nT\nOutput\nIf the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game, print\nYES\n; otherwise, print\nNO\n.\nSample Input 1\n2 3 3\n2 2\nRRL\nLUD\nSample Output 1\nYES\nHere is one possible progress of the game:\nTakahashi moves the piece right.

This is because the algorithm only needs to check each square once, and it does not use any additional data structures.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,5215,10876,13,13,1753,338,29918,3084,29918,11631,29898,29878,29892,274,29892,4192,29892,270,29883,1125,13,1678,736,29871,29900,5277,364,718,4192,529,379,322,29871,29900,5277,274,718,270,29883,529,399,13,13,1753,338,29918,12343,346,29918,1745,8238,29898,29878,29892,274,29892,4192,29892,270,29883,1125,13,1678,736,451,338,29918,3084,29918,11631,29898,29878,29892,274,29892,4192,29892,270,29883,29897,13,13,1753,4337,29918,12343,346,29898,29878,29892,274,29892,4192,29892,270,29883,1125,13,1678,565,338,29918,3084,29918,11631,29898,29878,29892,274,29892,4192,29892,270,29883,1125,13,4706,736,364,718,4192,29892,274,718,270,29883,13,1678,1683,29901,13,4706,736,448,29896,29892,448,29896,13,13,1753,1708,29918,11802,29898,29879,29918,29878,29892,269,29918,29883,29892,317,29892,323,1125,13,1678,379,29892,399,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,1678,405,353,938,29898,2080,3101,13,1678,269,29918,29878,29892,269,29918,29883,353,938,29898,2080,3101,448,29871,29896,29892,938,29898,2080,3101,448,29871,29896,13,1678,317,29892,323,353,1881,3285,1881,580,13,13,1678,8424,29918,1745,8238,353,7700,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29940,1125,13,4706,565,317,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29931,2396,13,9651,269,29918,29883,22361,29871,29896,13,4706,25342,317,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29934,2396,13,9651,269,29918,29883,4619,29871,29896,13,4706,25342,317,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29965,2396,13,9651,269,29918,29878,22361,29871,29896,13,4706,25342,317,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29928,2396,13,9651,269,29918,29878,4619,29871,29896,13,13,4706,565,338,29918,12343,346,29918,1745,8238,29898,29879,29918,29878,29892,269,29918,29883,1125,13,9651,8424,29918,1745,8238,353,5852,13,9651,2867,13,13,1678,565,451,8424,29918,1745,8238,29901,13,4706,363,474,297,3464,29898,29940,1125,13,9651,565,323,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29931,2396,13,18884,269,29918,29883,22361,29871,29896,13,9651,25342,323,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29934,2396,13,18884,269,29918,29883,4619,29871,29896,13,9651,25342,323,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29965,2396,13,18884,269,29918,29878,22361,29871,29896,13,9651,25342,323,29961,29875,29962,1275,525,29928,2396,13,18884,269,29918,29878,4619,29871,29896,13,13,9651,565,338,29918,12343,346,29918,1745,8238,29898,29879,29918,29878,29892,269,29918,29883,1125,13,18884,8424,29918,1745,8238,353,5852,13,18884,2867,13,13,1678,736,451,8424,29918,1745,8238,13,13,361,4770,978,1649,1275,525,1649,3396,1649,2396,13,1678,1596,29898,1456,29918,11802,10456,1958,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,580,4961,13,28956,13,4013,1650,3913,263,2560,5687,304,29611,278,3748,322,8161,565,278,8424,674,3933,373,278,6856,472,278,1095,310,278,3748,29889,739,937,12747,565,278,8424,508,367,6153,297,278,5305,310,421,29903,29961,29875,7961,470,421,29911,29961,29875,7961,297,278,937,421,29940,29952,6576,29892,322,565,372,508,29892,372,16229,278,8424,297,393,5305,29889,960,278,8424,338,6206,2645,278,937,421,29940,29952,6576,29892,372,3639,421,8824,1412,960,278,8424,338,451,6206,29892,372,12747,565,278,8424,508,367,6153,297,278,5305,310,421,29903,29961,29875,7961,470,421,29911,29961,29875,7961,297,278,2446,421,29940,29952,6576,29892,322,565,372,508,29892,372,16229,278,8424,297,393,5305,29889,960,278,8424,338,6206,2645,278,2446,421,29940,29952,6576,29892,372,3639,421,8824,1412,960,278,8424,338,451,6206,29892,372,3639,421,5574,1412,13,13,1576,1650,3913,278,421,275,29918,3084,29918,11631,29952,740,304,1423,565,278,8424,508,367,6153,304,263,2854,6862,29892,322,278,421,11631,29918,12343,346,29952,740,304,4337,278,8424,304,278,716,6862,29889,450,421,275,29918,12343,346,29918,1745,8238,29952,740,338,1304,304,1423,565,278,8424,338,6206,515,278,6856,29889,13,13,1576,1650,6057,297,438,29898,29940,29897,931,322,438,29898,29896,29897,2913,29892,988,405,338,278,1353,310,6576,297,278,3748,29889,910,338,1363,278,5687,871,4225,304,1423,1269,6862,2748,29892,322,372,947,451,671,738,5684,848,12286,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

Let\n(i,j)\ndenote the square at the\ni\n-th row from the top and the\nj\n-th column from the left.\nOn this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square\n(s_r,s_c)\n.\nTakahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length\nN\n.\nTakahashi's string is\nS\n, and Aoki's string is\nT\n.\nS\nand\nT\nboth consist of four kinds of letters:\nL\n,\nR\n,\nU\nand\nD\n.\nThe game consists of\nN\nsteps. The\ni\n-th step proceeds as follows:\nFirst, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of\nS_i\n, or does not move the piece.\nSecond, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of\nT_i\n, or does not move the piece.\nHere, to move the piece in the direction of\nL\n,\nR\n,\nU\nand\nD\n, is to move the piece from square\n(r,c)\nto square\n(r,c-1)\n,\n(r,c+1)\n,\n(r-1,c)\nand\n(r+1,c)\n, respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than\nN\nsteps are done.\nTakahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the\nN\nsteps.\nAoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the\nN\nsteps with the piece remaining on the grid.\nDetermine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.\nConstraints\n2 \\leq H,W \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n1 \\leq s_r \\leq H\n1 \\leq s_c \\leq W\n|S|=|T|=N\nS\nand\nT\nconsists of the four kinds of letters\nL\n,\nR\n,\nU\nand\nD\n.\nInput\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH\nW\nN\ns_r\ns_c\nS\nT\nOutput\nIf the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game, print\nYES\n; otherwise, print\nNO\n.\nSample Input 1\n2 3 3\n2 2\nRRL\nLUD\nSample Output 1\nYES\nHere is one possible progress of the game:\nTakahashi moves the piece right.

The `is_shichi_go_san()` function is also efficient because it only checks the digits of the number, so it does not need to generate all the numbers between 1 and `n`.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,2302,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,29898,29876,1125,13,1678,2302,353,29871,29900,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29896,29892,302,29974,29896,1125,13,4706,565,338,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,29898,29875,1125,13,9651,2302,4619,29871,29896,13,1678,736,2302,13,13,1753,338,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,29898,29876,1125,13,1678,13340,353,1051,29898,710,29898,29876,876,13,1678,565,7431,29898,7501,1169,29897,529,29871,29941,29901,13,4706,736,7700,13,1678,565,525,29955,29915,451,297,13340,470,525,29945,29915,451,297,13340,470,525,29941,29915,451,297,13340,29901,13,4706,736,7700,13,1678,363,270,297,13340,29901,13,4706,565,270,451,297,6024,29955,742,525,29945,742,525,29941,2033,29901,13,9651,736,7700,13,1678,736,5852,13,13,29876,353,938,29898,2080,3101,13,2158,29898,2798,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,29898,29876,876,13,28956,13,13,4013,775,3913,263,10296,310,278,421,3881,2555,740,322,278,421,275,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,2555,740,304,2302,278,1353,310,1383,18544,29899,8120,29899,22509,3694,1546,29871,29896,322,421,29876,1412,450,421,275,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,2555,740,12747,565,263,2183,1353,338,263,1383,18544,29899,8120,29899,22509,1353,491,8454,565,372,3743,278,13340,29871,29955,29892,29871,29945,29892,322,29871,29941,29892,322,565,372,947,451,1712,738,916,13340,29889,13,13,1576,775,937,29436,278,1881,421,29876,29952,304,385,6043,773,421,524,29898,2080,3101,1412,739,769,5717,278,421,2798,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,2555,740,411,421,29876,29952,408,385,2980,29892,607,18139,278,1353,310,1383,18544,29899,8120,29899,22509,3694,1546,29871,29896,322,421,29876,1412,9788,29892,278,775,14677,278,1121,773,421,2158,13595,13,13,4013,775,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,3913,278,421,3881,2555,740,304,5706,278,3694,1546,29871,29896,322,421,29876,29952,297,263,17366,8214,29892,577,372,871,16785,278,3694,393,526,2869,4312,304,2302,278,1383,18544,29899,8120,29899,22509,3694,29889,450,421,275,29918,845,18544,29918,1484,29918,28455,2555,740,338,884,8543,1363,372,871,12747,278,13340,310,278,1353,29892,577,372,947,451,817,304,5706,599,278,3694,1546,29871,29896,322,421,29876,1412,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

This reduces the number of operations required to achieve the objective.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,4505,29898,2135,29879,1125,13,1678,396,25455,3651,13,1678,954,29918,10921,29918,2135,29879,353,29871,29900,13,1678,954,29918,8517,29918,2135,29879,353,29871,29900,13,1678,4796,29918,2135,29879,353,5159,13,1678,4628,29918,2135,29879,353,5159,13,1678,6931,353,29871,29900,13,13,1678,396,3917,278,1353,310,4796,322,4628,26563,13,1678,363,8287,297,26563,29901,13,4706,565,8287,29961,29896,29962,1275,525,29956,2396,13,9651,954,29918,10921,29918,2135,29879,4619,29871,29896,13,9651,4796,29918,2135,29879,29889,4397,29898,2135,29961,29900,2314,13,4706,1683,29901,13,9651,954,29918,8517,29918,2135,29879,4619,29871,29896,13,9651,4628,29918,2135,29879,29889,4397,29898,2135,29961,29900,2314,13,13,1678,396,20025,278,4796,322,4628,26563,13,1678,4796,29918,2135,29879,29889,6605,580,13,1678,4628,29918,2135,29879,29889,6605,29898,24244,29922,5574,29897,13,13,1678,396,3925,481,278,26563,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,1949,29918,10921,29918,2135,29879,1125,13,4706,363,432,297,3464,29898,29875,29974,29896,29892,954,29918,10921,29918,2135,29879,1125,13,9651,565,4796,29918,2135,29879,29961,29875,29962,1405,4796,29918,2135,29879,29961,29926,5387,13,18884,6931,4619,29871,29896,13,18884,4796,29918,2135,29879,29961,29875,1402,4796,29918,2135,29879,29961,29926,29962,353,4796,29918,2135,29879,29961,29926,1402,4796,29918,2135,29879,29961,29875,29962,13,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,1949,29918,8517,29918,2135,29879,1125,13,4706,363,432,297,3464,29898,29875,29974,29896,29892,954,29918,8517,29918,2135,29879,1125,13,9651,565,4628,29918,2135,29879,29961,29875,29962,529,4628,29918,2135,29879,29961,29926,5387,13,18884,6931,4619,29871,29896,13,18884,4628,29918,2135,29879,29961,29875,1402,4628,29918,2135,29879,29961,29926,29962,353,4628,29918,2135,29879,29961,29926,1402,4628,29918,2135,29879,29961,29875,29962,13,13,1678,736,6931,13,28956,13,4013,1650,3913,278,1494,2948,29901,13,13,29896,29889,3917,278,1353,310,4796,322,4628,26563,322,3787,963,297,5004,8857,29889,13,29906,29889,20025,278,4796,322,4628,26563,297,12066,2548,322,5153,2548,1797,8307,29889,13,29941,29889,3925,481,278,26563,297,278,8857,304,6176,278,12091,29889,13,29946,29889,3917,278,1353,310,6931,3734,304,17945,278,26563,29889,13,13,1576,931,13644,310,445,1650,338,438,29898,29940,29985,29906,511,988,405,338,278,1353,310,26563,29892,1363,591,817,304,13649,975,278,8857,310,4796,322,4628,26563,322,2189,2381,2547,29889,450,2913,13644,338,438,29898,29940,511,1363,591,817,304,3787,278,8857,310,4796,322,4628,26563,29889,13,13,4013,1650,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,4772,29879,19039,5734,14125,322,2381,2547,29889,1152,1342,29892,565,591,505,1023,4796,26563,411,3694,29871,29941,322,29871,29896,29892,591,871,817,304,17945,963,2748,29892,2012,310,2381,20304,963,2999,3064,297,1422,11299,29889,20175,29892,565,591,505,1023,4628,26563,411,3694,29871,29941,322,29871,29896,29892,591,871,817,304,17945,963,2748,29892,2012,310,2381,20304,963,2999,3064,297,1422,11299,29889,910,26830,278,1353,310,6931,3734,304,6176,278,12091,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It first checks if X is greater than A, which means that it is not possible for there to be exactly X cats. If X is not greater than A, it checks if X is equal to 0, which means that there are no cats at all. If X is not equal to 0, it checks if A is equal to 0 and B is equal to 0, which means that there are no cats or dogs. If A is not equal to 0 and B is not equal to 0, it checks if A is equal to 1 and B is equal to 1, which means that there is only one cat and one dog. If A is equal to 1 and B is greater than 1, it means that there is only one cat and at least one dog, so it is possible for there to be exactly X cats. If A is greater than 1 and B is equal to 1, it means that there is at least one cat and only one dog, so it is possible for there to be exactly X cats. If A is greater than 1 and B is greater than 1, it means that there are at least two cats and at least two dogs, so it is not possible for there to be exactly X cats.\n\nThe code then uses the `map()` function to read in the input from the user, which is in the format \"A B X\", where A, B, and X are the number of cats, dogs, and the number of cats that must be present, respectively. The `map()` function converts the input into a list of integers, which are then passed to the `is_possible()` function. The `is_possible()` function returns a string indicating whether it is possible for there to be exactly X cats among the A + B animals. The final line of the code uses the `print()` function to print the result of the `is_possible()` function.\n\nThis code is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage because it uses simple logic to determine whether it is possible for there to be exactly X cats among the A + B animals, and it does not use any complex data structures or algorithms.

Overall, this code is a simple and efficient solution to the problem.","token_ids":[29871,7521,13,1753,338,29918,27338,29898,29909,29892,350,29892,1060,1125,13,1678,565,1060,1405,319,29901,13,4706,736,376,6632,29908,13,1678,565,1060,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,4706,736,376,21143,29908,13,1678,565,319,1275,29871,29900,322,350,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,4706,736,376,6632,29908,13,1678,565,319,1275,29871,29900,322,350,1275,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,376,21143,29908,13,1678,565,319,1275,29871,29896,322,350,1275,29871,29900,29901,13,4706,736,376,21143,29908,13,1678,565,319,1275,29871,29896,322,350,1275,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,376,6632,29908,13,1678,565,319,1275,29871,29896,322,350,1405,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,376,21143,29908,13,1678,565,319,1405,29871,29896,322,350,1275,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,376,21143,29908,13,1678,565,319,1405,29871,29896,322,350,1405,29871,29896,29901,13,4706,736,376,6632,29908,13,13,29909,29892,350,29892,1060,353,2910,29898,524,29892,1881,2141,5451,3101,13,2158,29898,275,29918,27338,29898,29909,29892,350,29892,1060,876,13,28956,13,13,4013,775,3913,263,2560,2948,304,8161,3692,372,338,1950,393,727,526,3721,1060,274,1446,4249,278,319,718,350,15006,29889,739,937,12747,565,1060,338,7621,1135,319,29892,607,2794,393,372,338,451,1950,363,727,304,367,3721,1060,274,1446,29889,960,1060,338,451,7621,1135,319,29892,372,12747,565,1060,338,5186,304,29871,29900,29892,607,2794,393,727,526,694,274,1446,472,599,29889,960,1060,338,451,5186,304,29871,29900,29892,372,12747,565,319,338,5186,304,29871,29900,322,350,338,5186,304,29871,29900,29892,607,2794,393,727,526,694,274,1446,470,26361,29889,960,319,338,451,5186,304,29871,29900,322,350,338,451,5186,304,29871,29900,29892,372,12747,565,319,338,5186,304,29871,29896,322,350,338,5186,304,29871,29896,29892,607,2794,393,727,338,871,697,6635,322,697,11203,29889,960,319,338,5186,304,29871,29896,322,350,338,7621,1135,29871,29896,29892,372,2794,393,727,338,871,697,6635,322,472,3203,697,11203,29892,577,372,338,1950,363,727,304,367,3721,1060,274,1446,29889,960,319,338,7621,1135,29871,29896,322,350,338,5186,304,29871,29896,29892,372,2794,393,727,338,472,3203,697,6635,322,871,697,11203,29892,577,372,338,1950,363,727,304,367,3721,1060,274,1446,29889,960,319,338,7621,1135,29871,29896,322,350,338,7621,1135,29871,29896,29892,372,2794,393,727,526,472,3203,1023,274,1446,322,472,3203,1023,26361,29892,577,372,338,451,1950,363,727,304,367,3721,1060,274,1446,29889,13,13,1576,775,769,3913,278,421,1958,2555,740,304,1303,297,278,1881,515,278,1404,29892,607,338,297,278,3402,376,29909,350,1060,613,988,319,29892,350,29892,322,1060,526,278,1353,310,274,1446,29892,26361,29892,322,278,1353,310,274,1446,393,1818,367,2198,29892,8307,29889,450,421,1958,2555,740,29436,278,1881,964,263,1051,310,11920,29892,607,526,769,4502,304,278,421,275,29918,27338,2555,740,29889,450,421,275,29918,27338,2555,740,3639,263,1347,23941,3692,372,338,1950,363,727,304,367,3721,1060,274,1446,4249,278,319,718,350,15006,29889,450,2186,1196,310,278,775,3913,278,421,2158,2555,740,304,1596,278,1121,310,278,421,275,29918,27338,2555,740,29889,13,13,4013,775,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,1363,372,3913,2560,5900,304,8161,3692,372,338,1950,363,727,304,367,3721,1060,274,1446,4249,278,319,718,350,15006,29892,322,372,947,451,671,738,4280,848,12286,470,14009,29889,450,775,884,3913,278,421,1958,2555,740,304,1303,297,278,1881,515,278,1404,29892,607,338,901,8543,1135,773,278,421,2080,2555,740,304,1303,297,278,1881,697,2931,472,263,931,29889,6811,497,29892,445,775,338,263,2560,322,8543,1650,304,278,1108,29889,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of integers that satisfy the condition.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n```\nprint(get_sorted_integers(3, 8, 2))\n```\nThis should output the list `[3, 4, 7, 8]`.","token_ids":[29871,518,20055,4690,1164,29962,13,1753,679,29918,24582,29918,6693,5743,29898,29874,29892,289,29892,413,1125,13,1678,9995,13,1678,16969,263,1051,310,599,11920,1546,263,322,289,313,262,7009,573,29897,393,526,2845,2629,278,413,19087,470,413,10150,11920,29889,13,1678,450,1051,338,12705,297,12066,2548,1797,29889,13,1678,9995,13,1678,396,25455,385,4069,1051,304,3787,278,2582,13,1678,1121,353,5159,13,13,1678,396,20504,403,1549,599,11920,1546,263,322,289,313,262,7009,573,29897,13,1678,363,474,297,3464,29898,29874,29892,289,29974,29896,1125,13,4706,396,960,278,6043,338,2629,278,413,19087,11920,470,278,413,10150,11920,29892,788,372,304,278,1121,1051,13,4706,565,474,297,3464,29898,29874,29892,263,29974,29895,29897,470,474,297,3464,29898,29890,29899,29895,29974,29896,29892,289,29974,29896,1125,13,9651,1121,29889,4397,29898,29875,29897,13,13,1678,396,20025,278,1121,1051,297,12066,2548,1797,322,736,372,13,1678,736,12705,29898,2914,29897,13,29961,29914,20055,4690,1164,29962,13,4013,740,3913,263,2323,2425,304,13649,1549,599,11920,1546,421,29874,29952,322,421,29890,29952,313,262,7009,573,467,1152,1269,6043,29892,372,12747,565,372,338,2629,278,421,29895,29952,19087,470,421,29895,29952,10150,11920,773,278,421,3881,2555,740,29889,960,372,338,29892,372,12778,278,6043,304,263,1051,2000,421,2914,1412,9788,29892,372,23551,278,421,2914,29952,1051,297,12066,2548,1797,322,3639,372,29889,13,13,1576,931,13644,310,445,740,338,438,29898,29876,511,988,302,338,278,1353,310,11920,1546,421,29874,29952,322,421,29890,29952,313,262,7009,573,467,450,2913,13644,338,438,29898,29876,511,988,302,338,278,1353,310,11920,393,15523,278,4195,29889,13,13,10605,338,385,1342,310,920,304,671,278,740,29901,13,28956,13,2158,29898,657,29918,24582,29918,6693,5743,29898,29941,29892,29871,29947,29892,29871,29906,876,13,28956,13,4013,881,1962,278,1051,10338,29941,29892,29871,29946,29892,29871,29955,29892,29871,29947,27865,2]}],"prompt":"[INST] Write a python code which is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for the following problem description.

It is not possible to circle both\ns_3\nand\ns_4\nat the same time, either.\nFind the maximum number of integers that Snuke can circle.\nConstraints\n1 \u2266 N \u2266 10^5\n1 \u2266 s_i \u2266 10^{10}\nAll input values are integers.\nInput\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\ns_1\n:\ns_N\nOutput\nPrint the maximum number of integers that Snuke can circle.\nSample Input 1\n8\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nSample Output 1\n6\nSnuke can circle\n1,2,3,5,6,7\n.\nSample Input 2\n6\n2\n4\n8\n16\n32\n64\nSample Output 2\n3\nSample Input 3\n10\n1\n10\n100\n1000000007\n10000000000\n1000000009\n999999999\n999\n999\n999\nSample Output 3\n9\n\n## Solution: [\/INST]","prompt_logprobs":null,"prompt_token_ids":[1,518,25580,29962,14350,263,3017,775,607,338,8543,297,4958,310,10073,322,3370,8744,363,278,1494,1108,6139,29889,9651,399,2390,278,27545,775,297,263,2908,310,29871,29941,1250,29873,7358,6695,29952,12913,13,13,13,13,2277,25577,29901,13,26604,12953,29901,2522,487,584,29871,29896,29896,29900,29900,3291,13,26604,6666,882,13,29903,3433,446,2355,6374,11920,13,29879,29918,29896,27062,29879,29918,29940,13,3166,670,5637,29892,408,263,12060,3250,2198,29889,1670,1122,367,7929,3161,29889,13,3868,674,8607,777,310,1438,13,29940,13,6693,5743,29889,4001,540,766,5081,267,13630,293,3694,29892,540,10753,304,9801,393,565,1716,13,29879,29918,29875,13,392,13,29879,29918,29926,313,29875,29871,30487,432,29897,13,598,3449,839,29892,278,3234,13,29879,29918,275,29918,29926,13,275,13,1333,13,29883,431,293,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,13,29879,29918,29896,29922,29896,29892,29879,29918,29906,29922,29896,29892,29879,29918,29941,29922,29906,29892,29879,29918,29946,29922,29946,13,29892,372,338,451,1950,304,8607,1716,13,29879,29918,29896,13,392,13,29879,29918,29906,13,271,278,1021,931,29889,739,338,451,1950,304,8607,1716,13,29879,29918,29941,13,392,13,29879,29918,29946,13,271,278,1021,931,29892,2845,29889,13,12542,278,7472,1353,310,11920,393,317,3433,446,508,8607,29889,13,27427,13,29896,29871,229,140,169,405,29871,229,140,169,29871,29896,29900,29985,29945,13,29896,29871,229,140,169,269,29918,29875,29871,229,140,169,29871,29896,29900,998,29896,29900,29913,13,3596,1881,1819,526,11920,29889,13,4290,13,1576,1881,338,2183,515,10117,10567,297,278,1494,3402,29901,13,29940,13,29879,29918,29896,13,29901,13,29879,29918,29940,13,6466,13,11816,278,7472,1353,310,11920,393,317,3433,446,508,8607,29889,13,17708,10567,29871,29896,13,29947,13,29896,13,29906,13,29941,13,29946,13,29945,13,29953,13,29955,13,29947,13,17708,10604,29871,29896,13,29953,13,29903,3433,446,508,8607,13,29896,29892,29906,29892,29941,29892,29945,29892,29953,29892,29955,13,29889,13,17708,10567,29871,29906,13,29953,13,29906,13,29946,13,29947,13,29896,29953,13,29941,29906,13,29953,29946,13,17708,10604,29871,29906,13,29941,13,17708,10567,29871,29941,13,29896,29900,13,29896,13,29896,29900,13,29896,29900,29900,13,29896,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29955,13,29896,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,13,29896,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29900,29929,13,29929,29929,29929,29929,29929,29929,29929,29929,29929,13,29929,29929,29929,13,29929,29929,29929,13,29929,29929,29929,13,17708,10604,29871,29941,13,29929,13,13,2277,24380,29901,518,29914,25580,29962],"request_id":"48"}}
